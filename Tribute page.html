      <h3>1. Use information wisely</h3>
      <p>Ninjas should be able to obtain information quickly, analyse it and turn it into knowledge – in short, a ninja should be an information specialist.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <h3>2. Train both body and soul</h3>
      <p>Ninjas need strong bodies and strong souls. They must be able to run at least marathon distance and should master some martial arts. Ninjas should also keep calm and be in control of their minds at all times. Before their work, ninjas perform Kuji Kiri – the ‘grid of nine syllable slashes’ hand-gesture ritual.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <h3>3. Learn the knowledge in nature</h3>
      <p>Ninjas should observe everything and learn from nature. In order to survive and fulfil their mission, ninjas should make the most use of this information. For instance, ninjas can make poisons from plants, insects and animals.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <h3>4. Learn a variety of skills</h3>
      <p>Ninjas should have a wide range of skills to help them succeed in their mission. For example, learn languages, play music, read books – with diverse knowledge comes greater power.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <h3>5. Communicate well</h3>
      <p>Ninjas should be good at communication with other people. Ninjas should be kind to everyone, and should not make enemies. Most of all, ninjas should not look strong – they should appear to be like ordinary people.</p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header>As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user stories describe what may be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.</header>
      </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      <header>When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.</header>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      <header>User stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.</header>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      <header>Mike Cohn defines acceptance criteria as "notes about what the story must do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete."[19] They define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended.</header>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      <header>The appropriate amount of information to be included in the acceptance criteria varies by team, program and project. Some may include 'predecessor criteria', "The user has already logged in and has already edited his information once".[This quote needs a citation] Some may write the acceptance criteria in typical agile format, Given-When-Then. Others may simply use bullet points taken from original requirements gathered from customers or stakeholders.</header>

    <section class="main-section">
      <header>In order for a story to be considered done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.</header>
